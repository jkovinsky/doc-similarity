The social structures of dolphins are intricate and highly organized. They live in groups called pods, which can consist of a few individuals to several dozen. Within these pods, dolphins form strong, lasting bonds, often engaging in cooperative behaviors such as hunting, playing, and protecting each other from predators. These social bonds are crucial for their survival and well-being, allowing them to work together to find food and care for their young. The dynamic interactions within dolphin pods showcase their ability to form complex social networks and exhibit loyalty and companionship.

# plagiarism-checker

**Summary**: The following script uses features from the `<filesystem>` library, which was introduced in `C++17`, along with a standard algorithm detecting the [longest common subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence) between two strings. 

**Usage**: When running with command line, the user will specify the name of a directory. The program will perform a pairwise comparison of all the files in that directory and then print the results with a measure of overalp to the console. The text files in `test` contain short descriptions about dolphins generated by ChatGPT. 

**Using Terminal**:
- cd into `plagiarism-checker-main`
- type `make` to verify that things compiled
- type `./plagiarism-checker-main test` to make a pairwise comparison of text files located in the `test` folder
